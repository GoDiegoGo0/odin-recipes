<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Typically this dish is made with flank steak, which is lean and has long, shreddy fibers, and is how the dish earned the name “old clothes.” It’s the traditional choice, but we find it can be a bit tough, even after it’s braised for a long time. We prefer chuck roast for its fat, tenderness, and richness, but at the end of the day, this will be good with whatever you have on hand. Serve with maduros (fried sweet plantains) and Cuban-style black beans.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> 3 pounds chuck roast, brisket, or flank steak </li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons (or more if using flank steak) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li> 2 large onions, chopped</li>
    <li> 2 red bell peppers, chopped</li>
    <li> 2 tablespoons Diamond Crystal or 3½ teaspoons Morton kosher salt</li>
    <li> 8 garlic cloves, finely grated</li>
    <li> ½ cup dry white wine</li>
    <li> 4 teaspoons sweet paprika</li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon dried Mexican or Italian oregano</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li> 1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
    <li> 2 bay leaves</li>
    <li> ¾ cup pimiento-stuffed Spanish olives, halved crosswise</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar</li>
    <li>Chopped cilantro, white rice, maduros, and black beans (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
   <ol>
    <li> Pat roast dry with paper towels. Heat oil in a large heatproof pot over high. Cook chuck roast, turning occasionally, until browned on both sides, 5–7 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.</li>
    <li> Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 250°. Cook onion, bell peppers, and salt (plus 2 Tbsp. oil if using flank steak), stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 12–14 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently and scraping bottom of pan, until vegetables are golden brown, 3–5 minutes. Stir in wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until evaporated. Stir in paprika, oregano, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne until vegetables are coated; continue to cook, stirring, until spices are fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and coarsely break up with a spoon (they’ll continue to break down as they cook). Bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> Nestle roast into tomato mixture and tuck in bay leaves on either side. Cover and transfer to oven. Braise roast and vegetables until meat is very tender and shreds easily, 2½–3 hours. Let cool 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Skim excess fat from sauce; discard bay leaves. Using a potato masher or 2 forks, tear and smash beef into sauce until it’s shredded and incorporated into sauce. Stir in olives and vinegar.</li>
    <li>Divide ropa vieja among plates. Top with cilantro. Serve with rice, maduros, and beans alongside.</li>
